    <section class="Content">
      <p>As a native Oregonian, life began for me in
        the autumn of 1986 in NW Portland. Although I spent most of my preadult life exploring the high desert of Central Oregon,
        I made my return to Portland to pursue a degree from Portland State and begin life away from
        anything familiar. With that said, I felt at home in Portland.</p>
        <br>
      <p>Upon receiving my bachelor's degree in history, I moved away to Milwaukee, WI for a change
        of scenery and an attempt to start anew. I enjoyed experiencing the mid-western culture,
        sophisticating my beer palate, and the overexaggerated winters. Though I never took root in
        Milwaukee and relocated back to Portland after a mere two years, it was a memorable growing
        experience, which helped lead me toward looking into a career in social work/education.</p>
        <br>
      <p>Back in the PNW, I embraced Portland as my city and took advantage of everything I had neglected
        during my first stretch-exploring restaurants, seeing shows, attending Blazers and Timbers games,
        visiting every brewery in the area, hiking, camping, biking, etc. I joined AmeriCorps for a year and
        taught elementary-aged students to discover if I ultimately wanted to pursue a career in education
        or social work. My experiences with AmeriCorps were rewarding and a lot of fun, however I learned
        I was not as passionate about a lifelong career in that field.</p>
        <br>
      <p>I spent some time reevaluating a direction I wanted to take my life and found myself enrolled in the
        PDX Code Guild Bootcamp, where I gained valuable skills to develop a career in web development.</p>
